This service is a regularly recommended approach for visitors arriving into Hong Kong. You can find a route using MTR (public subway transportation) map (attached). The nearest MTR stations to HKUST are Hang Hau (to the south of HKUST, exit B1) and Choi Hung (to the west of HKUST, exit C1). You can then take mini-buses (11,11M or 11S, all having signs showing "HKUST" as the destination) from these MTR stations. The bus ride takes about 10-15 minutes.</li><li>By taxi. A taxi ride from the Hong Kong airport to HKUST goes all the way east, takes about 40 minutes, and costs around HK$350 (US$45).</li></ol><h2>University map:</h2><p>UST location map, Campus map and IAS route map are attached.</p><h2>Dinner places:</h2><p>The lift map is attached to find the dinner place.
